                This is a website dedicated to the improbable love store of James and Simret. We met via a dating app late in 2021. Simret was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and James lived in Portland, Oregon, USA. We were separated by 8500 miles or 13,700 km, but we developed a connection despite the physical distance. James knew that Simret was special and traveled to Addis Ababa to meet his future wife. It soon became clear that Godâ€™s will had brought us together.

            <p class="main-p">
                We were married on May 28th, 2022 yet remain living apart due to pending immigration. While waiting to start our lives together James visits Simret as much as possible. We chat morning and night when our waking hours overlap. We have started this web site project to document our love and develop new skills together.
